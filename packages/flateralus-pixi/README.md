# @flateralus/pixi

PIXI.js adapter for the Flateralus animation framework.

This package provides a PixiAnimation class that extends the rendering-agnostic BaseAnimation from Flateralus core, implementing PIXI-specific lifecycle logic.

## Usage

Import `PixiAnimation` and extend it to create PIXI-powered, schema-driven animations with full control value management.
