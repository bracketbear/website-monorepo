# Tailwind v4 Customization Rule

Whenever you are working with Tailwind CSS in this project, you must:

- **Check the Tailwind version first.**
- If the project is using **Tailwind v4**, do **not** use a `tailwind.config.js` file for configuration or custom utilities.
- For Tailwind v4, use **pure CSS/PostCSS** to add custom styles, theme variables, and utilities.
- Always reference the official documentation for Tailwind 4 custom styles: [Tailwind v4: Adding Custom Styles](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles)
- Use the `@theme`, `@utility`, and `@layer` directives in your CSS as described in the docs for any customizations.
- Use arbitrary value syntax (e.g., `bg-[#fdf0d5]`) for one-off custom values, ensuring the class is present in your code so Tailwind generates the CSS.

**Never** assume a `tailwind.config.js` file is present or used in Tailwind v4 projects.
