# Logo Assets Rule

The Bracket Bear logo is centralized in the core library for consistent usage across all apps.

## Asset Location
- **SVG File**: [packages/core/src/assets/bracket-bear-logo.svg](mdc:packages/core/src/assets/bracket-bear-logo.svg)
- **React Component**: [packages/core/src/react/BracketBearLogo.tsx](mdc:packages/core/src/react/BracketBearLogo.tsx)

## Import Options

### 1. Direct SVG Import (Recommended for Astro)
```typescript
import BracketBearLogoSvg from '@bracketbear/core/assets/bracket-bear-logo.svg?url';
```

### 2. React Component Import
```typescript
import { BracketBearLogo } from '@bracketbear/core';
```

## Usage in Components
Import the logo component from the core library:
```typescript
import { BracketBearLogo } from '@bracketbear/core';
```

## Ticker Separators
Both ticker components now use the Bracket Bear logo as separators:
- **SkillsTicker**: [apps/portfolio/src/components/SkillsTicker.tsx](mdc:apps/portfolio/src/components/SkillsTicker.tsx)
- **ServiceTicker**: [apps/bracketbear-website/src/components/ServiceTicker.tsx](mdc:apps/bracketbear-website/src/components/ServiceTicker.tsx)

The logo appears as a small red circular icon between each ticker item, rotated -12 degrees for visual interest.

## Logo Properties
- Uses `currentColor` for fill, making it adaptable to different color schemes
- Responsive viewBox (400.89 x 249.73)
- Accepts className prop for custom styling
- Available as both SVG file and React component

## Migration from App Assets
The logo was previously duplicated in both Astro apps:
- `apps/bracketbear-website/src/assets/bracket-bear-logo.svg`
- `apps/portfolio/src/assets/bracket-bear-logo.svg`

These can now be removed since the core library version is used instead.
