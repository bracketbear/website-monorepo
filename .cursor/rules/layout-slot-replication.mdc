# Layout Slot Replication Rule

## Rule
When wrapping a core layout (e.g., ContentLayout) in a local layout component, always replicate any named slots that the core layout expects. This ensures that slot content from pages is passed through to the core layout correctly.

- Use the efficient syntax:
  ```astro
  <slot name="detail-blocks" slot="detail-blocks" />
  ```
  to forward named slots from the local layout to the core layout.

- Do this for all named slots used by the core layout (e.g., `title-pills`, `detail-blocks`, `cover-image`, `summary`, etc.).

## Why?
- Ensures that slot content provided by pages/components is rendered as intended.
- Prevents slot content from being dropped or ignored when using local layout wrappers.
- Keeps the slot API consistent across the app and core packages.

## Applies To
- All local layout wrappers in `apps/` that wrap core layouts from `@bracketbear/core`.
- Any new layouts or slot-based components added in the future.
