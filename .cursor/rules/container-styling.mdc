# Container Styling Preference

## Use `container mx-auto` Instead of Manual Max-Widths

When creating layout containers, prefer using Tailwind's `container mx-auto` utility over manually setting max-widths with classes like `max-w-4xl`, `max-w-5xl`, etc.

### Preferred Pattern:
```html
<div class="container mx-auto">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

### Instead of:
```html
<div class="mx-auto max-w-4xl">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

### Why This Matters:
- `container mx-auto` provides responsive behavior out of the box
- It automatically adjusts based on screen size breakpoints
- Reduces the need to manually manage different max-widths for different screen sizes
- Creates more consistent spacing across the application

### Exception:
Only use manual max-widths when you need very specific control over the content width that differs from the standard container behavior.

### Examples in the codebase:
- [apps/portfolio/src/pages/about.astro](mdc:apps/portfolio/src/pages/about.astro) - Uses manual max-widths that could be simplified
- [apps/portfolio/src/layouts/HeroLayout.astro](mdc:apps/portfolio/src/layouts/HeroLayout.astro) - Shows proper container usage
