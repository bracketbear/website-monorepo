# CMS Admin UI Rule

The Keystatic admin UI is available at `/keystatic` route in the CMS app.

## Accessing the Admin UI
1. Start the CMS development server: `cd apps/cms && npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/keystatic`
3. The admin UI will show all configured collections and singletons

## Content Management Workflow
1. **Create New Entries**: Click "New Entry" in any collection
2. **Edit Existing Entries**: Click on any entry to edit its fields
3. **Delete Entries**: Use the delete button in the entry editor
4. **Bulk Operations**: Use the checkboxes for bulk actions

## Collection Features
- **Slug Generation**: Automatic slug generation from title fields
- **Validation**: Real-time validation based on schema
- **Relationships**: Dropdown selectors for relationship fields
- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop image uploads
- **Rich Text**: Markdown editor for multiline text fields

## File Storage
- Content is stored as JSON files in [apps/cms/content/](mdc:apps/cms/content/)
- Images are stored in the same directory structure
- Changes are saved immediately to the file system

## Production Considerations
- The admin UI should be disabled in production builds
- Use environment variables to control access
- Consider using Keystatic Cloud for production deployments

## Schema Validation
- All fields are validated against the schema defined in [keystatic.config.tsx](mdc:apps/cms/keystatic.config.tsx)
- Invalid data will show error messages in the UI
- Required fields must be filled before saving
