# README Organization Standards

## Overview
This monorepo uses a hierarchical README structure to provide cohesive documentation across all projects and packages.

## README Structure Requirements

### Root README
The main [README.md](mdc:README.md) should include:
- Project overview and introduction
- Installation and development instructions
- **Table of Contents** linking to all project READMEs
- Quick navigation to key documentation

### Project READMEs
Each project in `apps/` and `packages/` should have a README.md that includes:
- Project-specific overview and purpose
- Installation and usage instructions
- **Table of Contents** linking to any sub-READMEs in that project
- Links back to the main monorepo README

### Sub-READMEs
When creating READMEs in subdirectories (like components, layouts, etc.), ensure they:
- Link back to their parent project README
- Are referenced in the parent project's README table of contents
- Follow consistent formatting and structure

## README Table of Contents Format

### Root README TOC Example:
```markdown
## Table of Contents

### Applications
- [Portfolio](/apps/portfolio/README.md) - Personal portfolio website
- [Bracket Bear Website](/apps/bracketbear-website/README.md) - Main company website
- [CMS](/apps/cms/README.md) - Content management system

### Packages
- [Core](/packages/core/README.md) - Shared components and utilities
- [Astro Content](/packages/astro-content/README.md) - Content management utilities
- [Flateralus](/packages/flateralus/README.md) - Interactive graphics library
```

### Project README TOC Example:
```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Documentation](#documentation)
  - [Components](/src/components/README.md)
  - [Layouts](/src/layouts/README.md)
- [Back to Monorepo](../../README.md)
```

## When Creating New READMEs

1. **Always** add a table of contents when creating a README in a project root
2. **Always** link back to the parent README
3. **Always** update the parent README's table of contents to include the new README
4. **Always** use relative paths for internal links
5. **Always** include a brief description of what the README covers

## File Naming
- Use `README.md` for main project documentation
- Use descriptive names for sub-READMEs (e.g., `components.md`, `api.md`)
- Place READMEs in the root of the directory they document

## Cross-References
- Link from monorepo README to all project READMEs
- Link from project READMEs to their sub-READMEs
- Link from sub-READMEs back to their project README
- Use relative paths for all internal links
- Include brief descriptions for each link
