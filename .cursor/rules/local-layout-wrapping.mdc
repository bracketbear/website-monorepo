# Local Layout Wrapping for App Navigation

## Rule
Each app (in `apps/`) must wrap its pages in a local layout component (e.g., `@/layouts/Layout.astro` or `ContentLayout.astro`).

- **Purpose:** This ensures that navigation, theming, and other configuration are controlled per app, allowing for app-specific branding and navigation structures.
- **How:**
  - Do **not** import layouts directly from `@bracketbear/core` in app pages.
  - Instead, create a local layout in each app that imports the core layout and configures it with the app's navigation and settings.
  - All pages in the app should use this local layout as their wrapper.

## Example
```astro
---
import ContentLayout from '@/layouts/ContentLayout.astro';
import { navigationConfig } from '@/config/navigation';
---

<ContentLayout navigation={navigationConfig} title="Page Title">
  <slot />
</ContentLayout>
```

## Why?
- Allows each app to have its own navigation, branding, and layout configuration.
- Supports future changes to navigation or theming without affecting other apps.
- Keeps the codebase modular and maintainable.

## Applies To
- All pages in `apps/portfolio`, `apps/bracketbear-website`, `apps/cms`, etc.
- Any new app added to the monorepo.
