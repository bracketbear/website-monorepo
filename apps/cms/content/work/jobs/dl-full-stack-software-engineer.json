My work streamlines development cycles for large-scale installations, enabling faster deployment and more immersive experiences for end users",

    "Drawing on my experiences at multiple experiential agencies—where I worked directly with software administrators, content managers, and developers—I regularly propose user-focused features and innovative ways of integrating Gumband with our clients' installations, ensuring faster rollouts, cost-effective solutions, and a better overall user experience"
