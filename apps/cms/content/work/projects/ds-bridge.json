  "problem": "Downstream needed a dependable CMS interface for experiential projects. The existing setup was split across versions and tooling, and the UI had to evolve while a Rust back end was taking shape.",
  "scope": [
    "Led front‑end development for Bridge UI",
    "Migrated components from Vue 2 → Vue 3 (during beta)",
    "Converted the app to TypeScript",
    "Moved the build from Webpack to Vite",
    "Implemented service workers for cross‑tab comms and delta polling",
    "Read Rust code to map/validate data shapes in the UI"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Adopted Vite for faster, simpler builds",
    "Introduced strict typing to stabilize integration with the Rust API",
    "Used a service worker to coordinate multiple tabs and background polling",
    "Established patterns for component structure and data flow so future work stayed consistent"
  ],
  "outcome": "A stable, faster UI layer that played nicely with the Rust services and made day‑to‑day authoring predictable.",
  "notes": "If I did it again, I’d generate types from the Rust models to remove a class of mapping bugs. This would have been a great way of keeping the two sides of the app in sync.",
