  "problem": "Elekta needed fine‑grained control of presentations across platforms, plus a way to expose quick actions via context menus and run the experience on Surface 3 tablets.",
  "scope": [
    "Designed the database schema for custom context actions",
    "Linked new buttons to existing content types",
    "Built a Vue 2 drag‑and‑drop editor for managing menus",
    "Helped adapt the experience for Surface tablets"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Modeled context actions as first‑class entities with clean relations",
    "Built a reusable menu editor instead of ad‑hoc forms",
    "Kept platform‑specific logic isolated so behavior stayed predictable"
  ],
  "outcome": "A more customizable app that let sales and executives tailor the experience quickly and display it on screens from executive board room LED walls to portable tablets in remote sales meetings.",
  "notes": "This was an interesting project for a few reasons. First, it was one of my first CMS projects from back when we built CMS apps on a per-project basis, and we injected some new menu building functionality into it. A few years later, I was able to hop into the experience side of the app to add new features, giving me a true experiential \"full-stack\" building experience while bringing things full-circle.",
