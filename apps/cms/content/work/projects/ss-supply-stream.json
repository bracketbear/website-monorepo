  "problem": "The existing theme wasn’t built for a modern component approach. We needed a cleaner architecture and a path off the template system without breaking the business.",
  "scope": [
    "Integrated Vue into BigCommerce’s Stencil theme",
    "Migrated to a headless front‑end (Vue 3 / Nuxt 3)",
    "Styled with TailwindCSS and wired to platform APIs"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Went headless to keep the UI fast and the integration straightforward",
    "Planned an incremental migration so the site could keep selling",
    "Kept the stack simple—fewer moving parts, easier to hand off"
  ],
  "outcome": "Enabled a shift from purely salesperson‑driven orders to organic online sales.",
  "notes": "If I revisited this, I’d add basic A/B hooks to measure UX changes more directly.",
