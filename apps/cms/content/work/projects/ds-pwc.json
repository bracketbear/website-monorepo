  "summary": "Unified app powering signage, LED film, a mosaic wall, and an interactive Learning Zone.",
  "oneLiner": "A multi‑screen installation for PwC built as a single application: elevator signage, LED film, a mosaic wall, and a Learning Zone.",
  "problem": "Previous projects split features across multiple small apps, which made operations harder. PwC needed one application that could drive very different displays and inputs, from LED film with lidar sensors to an interactive learning space.",
  "scope": [
    "Learned C++/Windows/Visual Studio quickly and contributed production code",
    "Built interactive modules for the Learning Zone, including an admin presentation mode",
    "Helped unify disparate screens into one application with consistent patterns"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Chose a single codebase to simplify deployment and support",
    "Modeled content per screen so each surface stayed flexible",
    "Mapped lidar inputs to visual effects with predictable scaling"
  ],
  "outcome": "A dependable installation that people gravitated to. Personal highlight: seeing the app live while looking out at the Capitol during install week.",
  "notes": "With more time I’d add lightweight telemetry and automated checks for multi‑screen edge cases.",
