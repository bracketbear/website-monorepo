  "oneLiner": "A multi‑screen installation for PwC built as a single application",

  "challengesAndSolutions": "- Learned C++/Windows/Visual Studio quickly and contributed production code\n- Built interactive modules for the Learning Zone, including an admin presentation mode\n- Used my previous CMS developer experience to integrate the entire team's modes into our CMS\n- Contributed an animated PNG sprite to our core C++ app building library, which was awesome considering my newness to the language\n- Developed the Learning Zone app with such accuracy that the client thought that we were showing them the motion graphics video that they had already approved\n- Traveled to Washington, D.C. while representing our company to install the front-end and CMS applications",
  "outcome": "A dependable installation that people gravitated to. Personal highlight: seeing the app live while looking out at the Capitol during install week.",
  "notes": "This was such a unique project because of the Learning Zone functionality. It was essentially a giant point-and-click animated pegboard of things to teach you about taxes and auditing—yay taxes and auditing! This was a great project to learn C++ in, and that learning eventually did wonders for getting rid of my imposter syndrome. Let's go!",
