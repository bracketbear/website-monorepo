  "oneLiner": "A service-based CMS for experiential teams—built to be dependable, not flashy.",
  "problem": "Agencies needed a CMS that didn’t fight their process. Most tools were web-first, fragile around devices/scheduling, or too bespoke to maintain. We set out to build a platform that handled real install constraints without slowing teams down.",
  "scope": [
    "Full-stack engineering on the core platform",
    "Defined service boundaries and simplified the data model",
    "Improved developer experience (docs in code, clearer local/dev flows)",
    "Standardized patterns for content → device sync and scheduling",
    "Partnered on product decisions and backlog prioritization",
    "Supported integrations and internal adopters"

  "decisions": [
    "Chose platform boundaries that matched on-site workflows",
    "Cut two nice-to-haves to stabilize content flows and QA earlier",
    "Wrote small utilities over framework-specific magic for maintainability",
    "Introduced predictable patterns for sync, status, and error handling",
    "Prototyped an integration plugin to unblock a partner team"
  ],
  "outcome": "A reliable CMS foundation teams could actually use. Clearer expectations about what the platform supported and faster onboarding for new work. (Project paused after org changes.)",
  "notes": "If I did it again, I’d pilot on one site and productize the patterns from there, and ship an integration SDK from day one.",
