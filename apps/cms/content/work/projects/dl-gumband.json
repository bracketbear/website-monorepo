  "description": "As a full-stack engineer at Gumband, I saw a real need for a solid CMS in the experiential industry—a tool that most agencies tend to overlook because it's not the flashy, revenue-driving part of the business. Drawing on my background as a creative technologist and CMS engineer, I pushed to reduce tech debt and boost efficiency, building a system that could work across a wide range of agency needs.",
  "challengesAndSolutions": "The toughest part was navigating the inherent complexity of experiential content management. Every agency has its own set of unique requirements, so creating a one-size-fits-all solution was a serious challenge. Leveraging lessons from my previous roles, I tackled this head-on—even though content management isn't the most glamorous side of immersive tech, I knew a robust solution was essential. It took a lot of creative problem solving and determination to convince stakeholders that investing in a scalable, productized CMS was the right move.",
  "resultsAchieved": "In the end, we delivered a kickass, service-based CMS that set a new benchmark in the industry. The project not only showcased significant technical achievements but also integrated hard-won lessons from my past experiences. Unfortunately, due to corporate restructuring and team layoffs, the future of the project remains uncertain.",
