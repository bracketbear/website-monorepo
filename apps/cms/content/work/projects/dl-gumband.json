  "problem": "Experiential agencies tend to invest as little as they can into their content management systems, either because they have to out of business necessity, or because they don't understand that their CMS is part of the experience.

  "challengesAndSolutions": "- Full-stack engineering on the core platform\n- Prototyped, pitched, and got stakeholder approval on a novel TouchDesigner integration that would have made building no-code Gumband-integrated apps a reality for the first time\n- Worked with principal software engineer to develop patterns that drastically reduced our technical debt and introduced new modularity patterns into our projects\n- Introduced fix into our front-end service that completely eliminated git merge issues that we were constantly running into with our icon system\n- Leaned on years of experiential tech experience to work with product team on delivering features tailored to our clients needs",
