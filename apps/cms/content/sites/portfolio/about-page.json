    "title": "Hey! I'm Harrison.",
    "content": "I've been working on the web in some form or another since high school. My first opportunity was at Polich Art Works—an art foundry that took a chance on a kid who's only selling point was that he could use a computer. There I was introduced to two concepts that would stay with me throughout my career: web technologies and art.\n\nLater, while working at a brewery, I was tasked with figuring out how to collect emails for and send a newsletter. Any sane or experienced person would have gone straight to MailChimp, but instead I taught myself PHP, built a form to collect emails on our website and send them to a database, and then another form to send the emails. That led to writing a WordPress theme and a couple of plugins to manage menus, and from there my software development journey started.\n\nFlash forward a few years later and 3,500 miles away. I was feeling stuck a few years into my career, so I took a three-month Laravel contract with an experiential shop in Portland, OR. Completely oblivious to the world of experiences, I saw a museum app driving content on a wall for the first time and flipped a switch in my head: I could get paid to write code that made the world a cooler place. Driven and determined, I pushed for the full-time role, got it, and have never looked back. Since then, I've spent years in experiential—working at Downstream and Deeplocal—building experience content management software, going on virtual and in-person installs, training clients on how to use our products, and learning as much as I can learning about the industry I love."

I spend time to tackle some of the pain points I've seen in the experiential industry to come up with solutions that help, not hinder, our users. I document, test, and CI/CD myself to sleep to make sure that I'm not shipping a dud.\n\n#### In short, I try to be a one-person team that feels like a ten-person team."

When I saw that their biggest pain point was integrating with TouchDesigner, I had an idea.\\\n\\\nI went back to our team and pitched a drop-in TouchDesigner integration. I took it from an idea to a functional proof-of-concept, and then presented it to leadership. The pitch worked and it change company priorities in the upcoming quarter. This would have made it possible to build apps with our management system without having to write a single line of code.\n"
