    "title": "My Story & Mission",
    "content": "I've been building digital experiences for over a decade, starting with simple websites and evolving into complex management systems and interactive experiences. My journey began with a curiosity about how things work, which led me to explore everything from frontend frameworks to backend architectures.\n\nMy mission is to create systems that not only solve problems but delight users. I believe that the best technology is invisible - it works so seamlessly that users don't even think about it. Whether it's a content management system that makes designers' lives easier or an interactive experience that captivates audiences, I focus on the human experience first.\n\nOver the years, I've worked across various industries and team sizes, from solo developer to leading teams of 12+ engineers. This diverse experience has taught me that successful projects require more than just technical skills - they need clear communication, thoughtful planning, and a deep understanding of user needs."
