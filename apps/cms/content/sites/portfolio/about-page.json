    "content": "I'm Harrison. I've been working on the web in some form or another since high school. My first real break was at Polich Art Works—an art foundry that took a chance on a kid who's only selling point was that he could use a computer. That path moved me from Dreamweaver and Photoshop to Flash and ActionScript, and eventually into building things because someone needed them.\n\nLater, working at a brewery, we needed a monthly newsletter. I taught myself PHP, built a very rough sender, and then moved us to Mailchimp. I wrote a WordPress theme and a couple of plugins to manage menus. None of it was glamorous, but it worked—and it taught me that good software starts with a real need and gets better in public.\n\nFeeling stuck a few years in, I took a three-month Laravel contract with an experiential shop. Seeing a museum app driving content on a wall flipped a switch: this wasn't just websites—it was the systems that let creative teams do their jobs without fighting the tools. I pushed for the full-time role, got it, and never looked back. Since then I've spent years in experiential—Downstream, Deeplocal—building management software, smoothing handoffs, and making the unglamorous parts dependable. I'm self-taught, practical, and happiest when the work helps a team breathe easier."

I like projects with clear ownership and a real outcome attached.\n\nI'm open to full-time roles, and I also partner with agencies and collaborators. Either way, the goal is the same: make the work easier to run tomorrow than it was today."

We re-sequenced work so integration and QA happened earlier, and cut two nice-to-haves that weren’t on the critical path.\n\nI ran a 15-minute daily check-in, kept notes visible to the whole team, and made decisions where ownership was fuzzy. We delivered on the date with no late-night scrambles—and the team got their weekend back."

On the flight home I wrote a rough TD plugin in Python that mapped content cues to operators—ugly but alive.\n\nThat demo unblocked their team and gave leadership a clear next step. We shifted the quarter to building the plugin properly and made integrations straightforward after that."
