    "content": "I've been working on the web in some form or another since high school. My first opportunity was at Polich Art Works—an art foundry that took a chance on a kid who's only selling point was that he could use a computer. There I was introduced to two concepts that would stay with me throughout my career: web technologies and art.\n\nLater, while working at a brewery, I was tasked with figuring out how to collect emails for and send a newsletter. Any sane or experienced person would have gone straight to MailChimp, but instead I taught myself PHP, built a form to collect emails on our website and send them to a database, and then another form to send the emails. That led to writing a WordPress theme and a couple of plugins to manage menus, and from there my software development journey started.\n\nFlash forward a few years later and 3,500 miles away. Feeling stuck a few years into my career, I took a three-month Laravel contract with an experiential shop in Portland, OR. Seeing a museum app driving content on a wall for the first time flipped a switch in my head: I could get paid to write code that made the world a cooler place. I pushed for the full-time role, got it, and have never looked back. Since then, I've spent years in experiential—Downstream, Deeplocal—building management software, going on virtual and in-person installs, and learning as much as I can learning about the industry I love."

I spend time to tackle some of the pain points I've seen in the experiential industry to come up with solutions that help, not hinder, our users. I document, test, and CI/CD myself to sleep to make sure that I'm not shipping a dud.\n\n#### In short, I try to be a one-person team that feels like a ten-person team."

We shifted the quarter to building the plugin properly and made integrations straightforward after that."
