    "content": "Since my first web job at an art foundry over 20 years ago, I've always enjoyed creating software that augments the physical space in some way. After working in the shadows of 50 foot art, you become slightly numb to things that don't take your breath away. Luckily for me, I fell into the experiential industry over five years ago and immediately fell in love, and since then I've been driven to build software for creative developers and designers to make the world more rad.\\\n\\\nI'm a full-stack software engineer who's been programming for over a decade. I started as a self-taught PHP developer, then dipped my toes in C++ experiential Windows apps (something I still can't believe I can say), and I've settled into being a well-seasoned Typescript engineer. I've been all over the map with the types of programs that I've built, and this has given me a wide breadth of experiences to pull from and reference. Instead of thinking of programming as a language-first subject, I instead focus on clean software architecture, modularity, and developer experience as the core pieces and then sprinkle languages and frameworks into the mix.\n\nBeyond my programming experience, I've also got years of professional experience in marketing, print design, business development, and high-volume restaurant management. While I wouldn't necessarily suggest this path for most people, myself included, these experiences have given me a very business and product focused mindset that I lean on to make myself a more well-rounded software engineer and leader. I feel that my understanding of value helps make me a hyper-efficient and reliable employee and partner. I also believe in Radical Candor and believe that not being candid is equivalent to not being honest. That said, I also try not to take myself too seriously, either—focus on what needs to be focused on.\\\n\\\nFinally, I'm a big believer in community. When I worked at North Country Brewing early on, I got to see first-hand how a company could leverage itself to produce cleaner sidewalks, better-funded fire departments, and host huge events that brought our neighborhood together. I also love meetups—I attend Futurespaces every week virtually and Fireside Meetup in Portland every other month—and at this point in my career I feel fortunate because I can be the person giving advice and sharing the lessons I've learned.\n",

    "content": "## Recently, I've been exploring a schema-first methodology for building experiential apps\n\nInstead of hammering an experience management system integration into an existing app, you define a contract that everything adheres to—your app, your rendering layer, your state manager, your CMS—literally everything. This automatically unlocks:\n\n- Automatic mode and control registration in your renderer or in your management system\n- Seeded randomness for controls without configuration\n- Mode configurations that can be saved locally, in a code base, or in a remote CMS\n\n### It gives you more time to create and be inspired\n\n**(more info coming soon)**\n"
