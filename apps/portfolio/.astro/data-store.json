I was also responsible for reading the backend Rust code to understand the shape of the data being received.","The project involved several complex aspects, such as adapting to Vue 3 during its beta, understanding the Rust back-end, and using service workers.\n\nThese challenges were tackled through a mixture of dedication, continuous learning, and effective problem-solving strategies.","Successful development of a new CMS, Bridge UI, with improved functionality and efficiency.","Blue Bridge UI logo.",[439],{"image":440,"caption":441},"src/assets/images/projects/ds-bridge/media/0/image.png","A screenshot of the Bridge setup wizard.",[121,99,185,73,79],"../../packages/portfolio-content/content/work/projects/ds-bridge.json","b02d1d66b8910c48","ds-elekta",{"id":445,"data":447,"filePath":455,"digest":456},{"title":448,"job":107,"duration":449,"description":450,"challengesAndSolutions":451,"resultsAchieved":452,"mediaDescription":453,"isFeatured":80,"category":389,"skills":454},"Elekta Executive Boardroom CMS","3 Months","This was an update to an app for an existing client. We were tasked with adding a bunch of additional features that would allow the client to customize their Boardroom presentations on a per-platform basis. The client also wanted to add functionality to create custom \"context\" menu buttons. Finally, we wanted to be able to make the apps work on Surface 3 tablets so their sales people could take the experience with them on trips and to conferences.","The custom context menu buttons were a real head scratcher. As a company, we hadn't really done this before so it was up to myself and the Experience Developer I was working with to figure out how to get it done. I designed the database schema and joined these new menu items to existing items that were already in the database. I also wanted to create a cool and intuitive way to manage the menu items, so I created a Vue 2 widget that could be used to drag-and-drop the menu items. This was my first time using Vue and I was very happy with the result!","A more customizable and user-controlled application that gave sales people and executives a really cool tool to sweep their clients off of their feet.","Two people walking in front of the Downstream screen.",[121,76,75,78,98,122,123],"../../packages/portfolio-content/content/work/projects/ds-elekta.json","31627124b0acf381","dl-gumband",{"id":457,"data":459,"filePath":467,"digest":468},{"title":460,"job":83,"duration":461,"description":462,"challengesAndSolutions":463,"resultsAchieved":464,"mediaDescription":465,"isFeatured":80,"category":389,"skills":466},"Gumband","15 Months","As a full-stack engineer at Gumband, I saw a real need for a solid CMS in the experiential industry—a tool that most agencies tend to overlook because it’s not the flashy, revenue-driving part of the business. Drawing on my background as a creative technologist and CMS engineer, I pushed to reduce tech debt and boost efficiency, building a system that could work across a wide range of agency needs.","The toughest part was navigating the inherent complexity of experiential content management. Every agency has its own set of unique requirements, so creating a one-size-fits-all solution was a serious challenge. Leveraging lessons from my previous roles, I tackled this head-on—even though content management isn’t the most glamorous side of immersive tech, I knew a robust solution was essential. It took a lot of creative problem solving and determination to convince stakeholders that investing in a scalable, productized CMS was the right move.","In the end, we delivered a kickass, service-based CMS that set a new benchmark in the industry. The project not only showcased significant technical achievements but also integrated hard-won lessons from my past experiences. Unfortunately, due to corporate restructuring and team layoffs, the future of the project remains uncertain.","Screenshots showcasing the Gumband dashboard and CMS interface.",[72,96,97,73,98,99,100,101,102,103,104],"../../packages/portfolio-content/content/work/projects/dl-gumband.json","c91a0a11ef9ea497","ds-pwc",{"id":469,"data":471,"filePath":479,"digest":480},{"title":472,"job":107,"duration":473,"description":474,"challengesAndSolutions":475,"resultsAchieved":476,"mediaDescription":477,"isFeatured":80,"category":383,"skills":478},"PwC Interactive Installation","1 Year","We were tasked with creating an application for PwC that would handle multiple types of screens with varying purposes: - a digital signage platform for the elevator lobbies that display the current time, photos, upcoming events, and announcements - a digital LED film screen that was placed over a glass wall that could be transparent when nothing was happening or it could show effects, messages, or completely block off visibility into the meeting room if needed. This screen also had lidar sensors that tracked when people walked past the wall and we used those coordinates as inputs that affected the way the effects would be displayed - a \"mosaic\" wall made up of multiple displays that could each show their own content or one image or effect, which created a non-rectangular effect that you can't really see in most digital experiences - the Learning Zone, which I had the most impact on, which was an interactive animated \"point-and-click\" type adventure that could teach you about taxes, auditing, and about PwC as a whole. There were about 20 different interactive widgets that a user could interact with. In addition, an admin could enter a password and access a presentation mode to display images, PDFs, and slide decks.","This project was challenging because there were a ton of things that we hadn't quite done before in a project. The biggest challenge that I faced was that this was my first professional experiential technology app. I had to learn C++ in about a month, then switch from MacOS to Windows, wrap my head around the behemoth that is Visual Studio, understand how our in-house framework worked, and then I had to understand graphics math. This felt like an insurmountable task at first, but luckily my team taught me lessons they had learned over the years and I was given plenty of space and time to make mistakes and to learn from them. I couldn't have asked for a better situation to take this project on. Second, this was the first project where we decided to have all of the platforms and screens run the same application. Previously, all of our projects would have smaller apps that would handle individual screens. This helped with separating concerns but also led to having to juggle multiple apps for the same client, which presented its own set of challenges. By merging all of the platforms into one application, we were able to come up with a solution that we would use in other projects down the road.","An amazing application that people gravitate towards whenever they see it. I actually got to travel to Washington D.C. to install the application before their office opened their doors to their employees for the first time. One of the coolest experiences I've had professionally was being able to see my app and the Capitol building at the same time.","Man standing in front of giant screen with interactive items on it.",[124,125,126,78],"../../packages/portfolio-content/content/work/projects/ds-pwc.json","fdc0771707a10c3a","ds-stoller-winery",{"id":481,"data":483,"filePath":491,"digest":492},{"title":484,"job":129,"duration":485,"description":486,"challengesAndSolutions":487,"resultsAchieved":488,"mediaDescription":489,"isFeatured":80,"category":389,"skills":490},"Stoller Winery Tasting Room","Three months","Worked on the development of a custom CMS for Stoller Family Estates. The CMS stored data for the winery that was used by our front-end OpenGL applications to enhance the customer experience. Two front-end apps consumed the data: a \"Tasting Table\" app that provided customers with information about the wine, a 3D map of the winery, newsletter signup, and wine ordering capabilities, and a \"Barback\" app that displayed images of the estate, upcoming events, and real-time weather and live feeds.","Striking the balance between making the CMS robust enough to handle a variety of data types and making it intuitive enough for content administrators to use was difficult. Solution: We successfully achieved this by using a user-centric design approach, prioritizing ease of use without compromising on the versatility of the CMS.","The project's success was underscored by the fact that Stoller Family Estates was named Oregon’s Most Admired Winery multiple times and was listed in the 10 Best Tasting Rooms by USA Today 10 Best Reader’s Choice poll multiple times.
