        MY STORY

        <p>
          I started coding because I was curious about how things worked. That
          curiosity turned into a passion, and that passion turned into a
          career. I've always been the kind of person who takes things apart to
          understand them, then puts them back together better than before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I've learned that the best solutions aren't always the
          most complex ones. Sometimes the simplest approach is the right
          approach. I've worked with teams that over-engineered everything and
          teams that under-engineered everything. The sweet spot is somewhere in
          between - build what you need, plan for what you might need, and keep
          it maintainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies,
          mentoring other developers, or working on side projects that push my
          boundaries. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge -
          because the best engineers are the ones who never stop growing.

        MISSION STATEMENT

        <p>
          I build digital solutions that work. No fancy buzzwords, no
          over-engineering, just solid code that solves real problems. Think of
          me as your digital contractor - I show up, I work hard, and I get the
          job done right.
        </p>
        <p>
          From startups to Fortune 500s, I've been the guy who fixes what's
          broken and builds what's needed. When you need someone who can handle
          the full stack - frontend, backend, design, deployment - I'm your
          engineer.
